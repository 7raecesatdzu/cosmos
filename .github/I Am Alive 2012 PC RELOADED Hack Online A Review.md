# I Am Alive (2012) PC [RELOADED] Hack Online: A Review
 
I Am Alive is a survival game that puts you in the shoes of a man who returns to his hometown after a cataclysmic event. You have to scavenge for resources, climb buildings, and fight off bandits in a desolate and dangerous environment. The game was originally developed by Darkworks, but was later taken over by Ubisoft Shanghai and released as a downloadable title in 2012.

The game has some interesting ideas, such as a stamina system that limits your climbing and running abilities, a combat system that relies on bluffing and intimidation, and a dark and gritty atmosphere that conveys the hopelessness of the situation. However, the game also suffers from many flaws, such as poor graphics, repetitive gameplay, frustrating controls, and a lackluster story. The game received mixed reviews from critics and players alike, with some praising its originality and challenge, and others criticizing its technical issues and design choices.
 
If you are looking for a hack online to play I Am Alive on PC, you might be disappointed. The game is protected by Ubisoft's DRM system, which requires an internet connection to play. There are some cracks and patches available online, but they are not guaranteed to work and may contain viruses or malware. Moreover, hacking the game may ruin the intended experience of the game, as it is designed to be challenging and immersive.
 
Therefore, I would not recommend hacking I Am Alive online. Instead, you can buy the game legally from Steam or other platforms for a reasonable price. Alternatively, you can try other survival games that offer similar or better gameplay experiences, such as The Last of Us, Fallout 3, or Metro 2033.

If you are interested in playing I Am Alive, you might want to check out some gameplay tips to help you survive the harsh environment. Here are some useful advice from various sources:
 
- Use your stamina wisely. Don't run or climb unnecessarily, and plan your routes carefully. Look for resting points and items that can restore your stamina. If your stamina bar depletes completely, you will start losing health and eventually die.
- Use your gun sparingly. Ammo is very rare and valuable, so don't waste it on enemies that can be avoided or intimidated. You can bluff your way out of some situations by pointing your gun at enemies, even if it's empty. However, some enemies will call your bluff and attack you anyway, so be prepared to switch to melee or run away.
- Use your environment to your advantage. You can lure enemies into traps, such as explosive barrels or electric wires. You can also use ledges and gaps to kick enemies off or make them fall. Be careful not to fall yourself, though.
- Explore every corner. You might find hidden items, such as food, water, medicine, ammo, or upgrades. These items can make a big difference in your survival, so don't miss them. However, be aware of the risks involved in exploring, such as dust exposure or enemy ambushes.
- Be careful with survivors. Some of them are friendly and will offer you help or rewards if you help them. Others are hostile and will try to kill you or rob you. You can choose to help them, ignore them, or kill them, but be ready to face the consequences of your actions.

I hope these tips will help you enjoy I Am Alive more. The game is not easy, but it can be rewarding if you overcome its challenges.
